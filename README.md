# Powerpaint
This project tests my increasing understanding of writing graphical applications in Java. The key concepts are 2D graphics, mouse events, and some new Swing components.

This is the first time I build everything from scratch from back end to front end. Powerpaint allows a client to draw certain shapes with varying colors and sizes. The menu bar provides customization options utilizing various Swing components.
